# Get Next Line (GNL) - Efficiently Read Lines from a File Descriptor

Description:
Get Next Line (GNL) is a function that reads from a given file descriptor and returns a line, stopping when it encounters a newline character (\n) or the end-of-file (EOF). This project aims to develop an efficient and reliable method for reading lines from a file or input stream, handling edge cases and potential errors gracefully.

Features:

Reads and returns one line from the file descriptor at a time.
Handles newline characters and EOF correctly.
Manages memory efficiently to prevent leaks.
Modular code structure for easy integration into other projects.
